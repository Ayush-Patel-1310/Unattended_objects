Three Files:-

Unattended.py - Main file
centroidtracker.py - file used for tracking the object
Yolo8x.pt - Used to detect the bag in the video


Unattended.py:-

Gets the video and uses the centroidtracker to track every person n the frame. And draws an box around the object and also track the movement of the people walking in the frame. Asigns different ids to different object as the cordinates may get overlap and due to that we may get unwanted result.
Saving the resultant output in the file final1.mp4.(variable - out)


Centroidtracker.py:-

Gets the  frames and asigns different ids to different person and compares frame by frame the movement of the person.https://www.scener.com/@ayushpatel1310
